# Majordomus - Open source system for Smart Home
Majordomus is open hardware and open source system not only for smart home. Majordomus HW devices communicating via RS-485 interface with a gateway (for example RPi). This gateway makes an MQTT interface for commonly used SW applications for Smart Home (for example node-red).
See diagram below. Majordomus can do the blue parts from the diagram. Enjoy Majordomus in your project!
