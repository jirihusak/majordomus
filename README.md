# Majordomus - Open source system for Smart Home
Majordomus is open hardware and open source system not only for smart home. Majordomus HW devices communicating via RS-485 interface with a gateway (for example RPi). This gateway makes an MQTT interface for commonly used SW applications for Smart Home (for example node-red).
See diagram below. Majordomus can do the blue parts from the diagram. Enjoy Majordomus in your project!

## Majordomus SW

### Majordomus Control
This application makes the bridge between RS-485 bus and MQTT. The application has also GUI for real time controling the state of all devices. You can update devices to newer firmware.

### Node-Red nodes

- Scheduler
  Node for week based scheduling. You can set the rules with priorities and the node will send value from current rule.
